A portfolio introduction is a concise overview that introduces you, explains the portfolio's purpose and theme, and encourages the reader to explore its contents. It should function as an "elevator pitch," highlighting your top skills and qualifications while briefly introducing the work samples and the value they provide to the audience, such as potential employers or clients.
